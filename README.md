# POLY-Z RNG - Ultimate Undetectable Auto-Headshot Script

## 🎯 Project Mission: Super Results While Completely Avoiding KnightMare

This script achieves **maximum exploitative results** through perfect synchronization with KnightMare's anti-cheat system, delivering **superhuman performance** while remaining **100% undetectable**.

### 🚀 Current Status: V2 Clean Version
- ✅ **GUI loads correctly** - Rayfield interface displays properly
- ✅ **Basic auto-headshot** - Simple combat functionality working
- 🔄 **Performance enhancement** - Adding burst fire and multi-target capability
- 🎯 **Target: 700 zombies in 60 seconds** - Ultimate performance goal

---

## 🎯 Anti-Detection Technologies Implemented

### 1. **Humanized Remote Firing**
- **Random timing variance** (15-30% deviation per action)
- **Rate limiting** (max 50 shots per 5 seconds)
- **Single-target-per-cycle** behavior (mimics human aim)
- **Randomized target selection** (prevents predictable patterns)

### 2. **Smooth Property Modifications**
- **Gradual WalkSpeed transitions** (incremental changes, not instant)
- **Persistent on respawn** (maintains settings naturally)
- **CFrame interpolation** for movement (Lerp-based smoothing)

### 3. **Anti-Spam Protection**
- **Randomized delays** between crate openings (0.12-0.18s variance)
- **Batch cooldowns** (0.7-1.3s between batches)
- **Remote existence checks** (prevents error spam)

### 4. **Pattern Obfuscation**
- **Non-uniform timing** on all automated actions
- **Health checks** before targeting (skips dead enemies)
- **Smooth orbital movement** (no instant teleportation)

## 📋 Current Features (V2 Clean Version)

### ⚔️ Combat Features

#### 🎯 Perfect Defense Auto-Headshot
- **KnightMare synchronization** - Perfect game behavior replication
- **Smart targeting** - Finds closest enemy and shoots
- **Raycast validation** - Uses exact game parameters
- **Error protection** - Full pcall coverage
- **Basic functionality** - Single target elimination

**Current Implementation:**
1. Detects enemies within range
2. Sorts by distance (closest first)
3. Performs raycast with game's exact parameters
4. Shoots first valid target
5. Waits for next cycle

**Current Settings:**
- Shot delay: `0.1` seconds (configurable)
- Max range: `200` studs (configurable)
- Single target per cycle

#### ⏩ Auto Skip Round
- Safe remote firing with error protection
- Uses randomized delays internally

#### 🏃‍♂️ Walk Speed
- **Smooth speed transitions** (no instant changes)
- Persistent across respawns
- Range: 16-200 units
- Gradual incremental changes to avoid detection

**Recommended Settings:**
- Max safe speed: `50-100` units
- Extreme speeds may draw attention

### 🌀 Mod Features

#### 🌪️ Orbit Boss (360° Smooth)
- **Full 360-degree coverage** (no LOS issues)
- **Smooth CFrame interpolation** (prevents teleport detection)
- **Auto-detect nearest boss** (GoblinKing, CaptainBoom, Fungarth)
- **Health checking** (stops orbiting dead bosses)
- Configurable speed, radius, and smoothness

**Recommended Settings:**
- Rotation Speed: `5-8` (natural movement)
- Orbit Radius: `15-25` units (optimal range)
- Movement Smoothness: `0.15` (balanced)
  - Lower values = smoother (0.05) but may lag
  - Higher values = faster (0.3) but less smooth

**How It Works:**
- Maintains full 360° circular orbit around boss
- Never breaks line of sight
- Smooth interpolation prevents teleport flags
- Auto-resets on respawn

---

### 🎁 Crate Opening Features

#### Available Crate Types:
- 🕶️ Camo Crates (Random)
- 👕 Outfit Crates (Configurable type)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Anti-Detection Mechanisms

**1. Timing Randomization**
```lua
-- Example: Humanized delay function
local variance = baseDelay * (0.15 + math.random() * 0.15)
return baseDelay + variance
```

**2. Rate Limiting**
```lua
-- Tracks shots per time window
if shotCount >= 50 then return false end
```

**3. Smooth Transitions**
```lua
-- Gradual WalkSpeed changes
humanoid.WalkSpeed = current + (difference * progress)
```

**4. CFrame Interpolation**
```lua
-- Smooth orbital movement
HRP.CFrame = lastCFrame:Lerp(targetCFrame, smoothness)
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

### Safe Usage Recommendations

**Low Detection Risk:**
- Shot delay: ≥ 0.15s
- Walk speed: ≤ 100
- Crate quantity: 1-25
- Orbit smoothness: 0.15

**Medium Detection Risk:**
- Shot delay: 0.08-0.14s
- Walk speed: 100-150
- Crate quantity: 50-100

**High Detection Risk (Not Recommended):**

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't spam toggle features** - Rapid on/off may trigger detection
2. **Use natural-looking values** - Extreme settings draw attention
3. **Combine features strategically** - Auto headshots + Orbit = powerful combo
4. **Monitor your stats** - Unusual K/D ratios may flag manual review
5. **Take breaks** - Constant automation for hours is suspicious
6. **Vary your timing** - Don't use the same delay values every session
